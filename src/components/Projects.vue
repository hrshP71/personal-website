            <p> Would you click to the next one too? üòØ </p>
            <p>Anyawys, yes! Some details about me, I prepared around 10 websites &amp; 2 libraries (1 strict JS ads plugin 1 full design system component library), some mobile applications that you perhaps wouldn't like but I love them! Please do not assume I have done only parts of them, ask me anything about'em!</p>
            <p>I also aspire to be full-stack, NodeJS and Python Flask is my preffered backend language of choice even though I've used to code in PHP.</p>
            <p>Flutter, yes please. Glad world is full of things to learn!</p>
            <p>Most of the things I know by memory in frontend, you can test it</p>
            <p>Yikes, this place sounds too egoistic, how are you? I hope you have a wonderful day because you clicked here!</p>

              I laugh a lot to even to simpler things, it is a natural reaction that I never hold back,
              people around me says my laugh is funny and it also makes them laugh, without knowing what
              was my point. I like everything from light humour to dark humour but it needs to have a
              sense of intelligence in it, I don't enjoy when comedians scream to be funny. I do
              everything in my power to rescue back-end developers in non-cooperating work enviroments.
              They'd confirm that. I don't wanna sound boring here but I don't drink more than 2-3 times a
              year, I smoke tho I want to quit it. I don't play video games because I had addiction to it
              before and lessons were learned. I only play an AFK game on my mobile which requires 30 mins
              max daily. I started reading psychology and science books recently. I love cooking and I was
              a professional basketball player until the age 18. Which is sadly collage exams year in my
              country and we have a tough exam to get placed to what we want to work in, I am a graduate
              from highest score Software Engineering faculty in my country.
              Done Capstone on BEMOSS-kind as a web and mobile developer as well contributing with full
              stack website and mobile application, which is a project combining/operating all electronics
              with API's to sum up the main idea.

              Fun fact, I used to teach English as private and classroom tutor. I was considering this as
              a career and paused my school and was about to chase it in a collage as well. Until a
              student of mine was a software engineer and by the time I got involved in the process I
              realized how much I would love doing this compared to what I was doing back then. So I came
              back to this profession, no regrets!
